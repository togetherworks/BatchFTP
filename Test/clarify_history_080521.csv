there is no need for ANY credit to this customer.

This is definitely a training issue and luck of understanding od minimum spend plans and their presentation on the invoice:

cusomers on Yes Business Smart plans can share the amount of their minimum spend across ALL services on the account, 
thus applicable discounts are being shown on ACCOUNT LEVEL CHARGES/ DISCOUNTS section.

as you can see $189.41 of ELIGIBLE usage for ALL services on this account that signed for Yes Business Smart plan(s) was credited.

You can go through excrecise and add up ALL ELIGIBLE usage on the account - this will assure you that the customer have recieved his credits in full.

Hope this helps.",|"",
